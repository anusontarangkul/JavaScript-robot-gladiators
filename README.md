A Fun robot ðŸ¤– attack game. You get to create a robot at the start. You will enter multiple rounds fighting enemy robots. You can choose to FIGHT or SKIP. You have health as well as the enemies. You also have a random attack point.

## Code Highlights

Object oriented design to create players.

```JavaScript

var playerInfo = {
    name: getPlayerName(),
    health: 100,
    attack: 10,
    money: 10,
    reset: function () {
        this.health = 100;
        this.money = 10;
        this.attack = 10;
    },
    refillHealth: function () {
        if (this.money >= 7) {
            this.health += 20;
            this.money -= 7;
        } else {
            window.alert("You don't have enough money!");
        }

    },
    upgradeAttack: function () {
        if (this.money >= 7) {
            window.alert("")
        }
        this.attack += 6;
        this.money -= 7;
    }
}
```

Shop function using switch cases to allow players to make different choices.

```JavaScript
var shop = function () {
    // ask player what they'd like to do
    var shopOptionPrompt = window.prompt('Would you like to REFILL your health, UPGRADE your attack, or LEAVE the store? Please enter "1" for REFILL, "2" for UPGRADE, or "3" for LEAVE.');
    shopOptionPrompt = parseInt(shopOptionPrompt);
    switch (shopOptionPrompt) {
        case 1:
            playerInfo.refillHealth();
            break;
        case 2:
            playerInfo.upgradeAttack();
            break;
        case 3:
            window.alert("Leaving the store.");
            break;
        default:
            window.alert("You did not pick a valid option. Try again.");
            shop();
            break;
    }
}
```

Local Storage to save high score

```JavaScript
    if (playerInfo.money > highScore) {
        localStorage.setItem("highscore", playerInfo.money);
        localStorage.setItem("name", playerInfo.name);
        alert(playerInfo.name + " now has the high score of " + playerInfo.money + "!");
    } else {
        alert(playerInfo.name + " did not beat the high score of " + highScore + ". Maybe next time!");
    }

    // play again
    var playAgainConfirm = window.confirm("Would you like to play again?");
    if (playAgainConfirm) {
        startGame()
    }
    else {
        window.alert("Thank you for playing Robot Gladiators! Come back soon!");
    }

```
